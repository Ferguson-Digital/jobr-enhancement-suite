# Jobr Plus

A Chrome and Firefox extension to make Jobr usable.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Chrome requires a manifest version of 3, and Firefox requires a manifest version of 2. Otherwise, the code for both doesn't diverge significantly, but it will diverge more and more as we add things like settings panels.
